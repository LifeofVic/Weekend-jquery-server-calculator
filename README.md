Jquery Server Calculator

## Description
Duration: 16 hours.

For our weekend assignment from Prime, we had to create a calculator that stored the logic of the calculator and history inputs from the user in the servers. This assignment focused on moving data from the client side and sending to the server where the calculation fom the values were calcualted. The data that was sent to the server will then have to be sent back to the client that displayed the input values along with the results. I was able to make this happend by encapsulating the data that was entered into an object with the corresponding values and update the value in the object's property to be able to store and return the result. Since this requiered using the AJAX methods to GET and Psot then the only way to pass information was to move around objects contain the data. This data will ultimate contain the information needed to render the html file with the values for the client to see.
